<h1 class="title">The pronouncation of 'research'</h1>

<p>
<b><i>Research is pronounced as re-search!</i></b>
</p>

&#x2014;&#x2014; <i>Research</i>

<p>
Research, in many's eyes, is serious. Consequently, this question should be answered seriously.
</p>

<p>
Imaging that you wanna kiss that lovely girl. How do you do this?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>date with her first?
</li>
<li>tell her that you wanna to kiss her second? or 
</li>
<li>shy of doing this?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It must be noted that you are in the imagination! Don't think too much! The perfect is the enemy of the good!
I would kiss her directly (in imagination) if I were you :
</p>
<pre class="example">
The action of kiss is "curling your lip up", and thus making a pronouncation : /ri/. I just did it, I pronounced it shortly because she------
</pre>
<p>
See that we've pronounced 're'! What's the following?  What's the remaining? What's the things we should do next?
</p>
<pre class="example">
She felt shy and went away, I felt that she didn't like me. I------
</pre>
<p>
    Don't forget it : what you want to do is 'kiss her', and you've done it. everyone should get happyness when he achieved his goal.
Why do you look so nervous and, are you happy?
</p>
<pre class="example">
I must do something wrongly! She will never come back and I will never meet her again! How could I ......, I felt lost and she------
</pre>
<p>
No, I am not. I found that pronouncing 're' is easy, but I don't know what to do next, I don't know how others look upon me.
</p>
<pre class="example">
She came back into the memories and blushed again. How could he be so aggresive and reckless? Did he notice that I am not angry over 
appearance? She decided to forgive me but I------
</pre>
<p>
    Rechecking your goal, you haven't finished it. As has it already been said, these stories are the pronouncation of "research".   
you just pronounced 're', by "curling your lip up". The remaining should continue to pronounce: 'search'. That's exactly what you should do.
</p>
<pre class="example">
I didn't know, I didn't know how she look upon me. Was she angry? I didn't know. but the fact was that I missed her and she was missing,
I decided to search her, though she may want to keep away from me. I ran on the road she walked and she------
