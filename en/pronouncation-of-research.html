Imaging that you wanna kiss that lovely girl. How do you do this?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>date with her first?
</li>
<li>tell her that you wanna to kiss her second? or
</li>
<li>shy of doing this?
</li>

<p>
It must be noted that you are in the imagination! Don't think too much! The perfect is the enemy of the good!
I would kiss her directly (in imagination) if I were you.

It was a bright day in June, in a narrow side street near the library. I met
her. She said hello, something was transmitted with acoustic speed from her
red lips to my muddleheaded heart. Was she kissing me? The way that she
flipped her hair got me overwhelmed. I was thinking about kissing her back.
The action of kiss is "curling your lip up", and thus making a pronouncation : <b>re</b>.
I just did it with light speed, I pronounced it shortly because she&#x2014;&#x2014;
</p>
</div>
<p>
Hear that I've pronounced 're'! What's the following?  What's the remaining? What's the things I should do next?
</p>
<div class="center">
<p>
She felt shy and went away, I felt that she didn't like me. I&#x2014;&#x2014;
</p>
</div>
<p>
Congratulations! You've made a little progress on your road. But why do you look so nervous? what's wrong with you? and are you happy?
</p>
<div class="center">
<p>
I must do something wrongly! She will never come back and I will
never meet her again! How could I &#x2026;&#x2026;, I felt lost but she&#x2014;&#x2014;
</p>
</div>
<p>
No, I am not. I found that pronouncing 're' is easy, but I don't know what to do next, there must be something missed.
</p>
<div class="center">
<p>
She came back into the memories and blushed again: How could he be
so aggresive and reckless? Did he notice that I am not angry over
appearance? She was hanging around and didn't know what to do, I&#x2014;&#x2014;

Rechecking your goal, you haven't finished it. As has it already been said, this story talks about the pronouncation of "research".
you just pronounced 're', by "curling your lip up". The remaining should continue to pronounce: 'search'. That's exactly what you should do.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Search</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<div class="center">
<p>
<i>I didn't know her feelings. Was she angry? I didn't know.</i>
<i>I missed her and she was gone, I decided to search her. She------</i>
</p>
</div>
<p>
It sounds right but plausible, no one 'should' do something. That one will do it is because he want, but not he should.
In this context, how about giving up after pronouncing 're'? It may be unreasonable for someone that giving up halfway,
but maybe it's normal/trivial for someone else that doing the same. What about my decision? I want to finish it.

I ran on the road she walked, climbed
the mountain, and finally arrived at the top of the world.
But, where was she? I
