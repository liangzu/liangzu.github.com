<h2 id="orgheadline1">FAQs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
This article provides my personal answers about some <i>what, how, and why</i> questions, shaping some philosophy and aesthetics of mine.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline2">Is this the first question?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
Yes, it is.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline3">Why writing FAQs instead of self-introduction?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
This idea is stolen from <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html">Bjarne Stroustrup's Homepage(faqs)</a> and <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/1632977/">The little schemer</a>. The former showed that FAQs make articles easier to be organized 
, the later proved FAQs can lead more fun.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline4">Who asked those questions?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
It sounds like "who write this article".Of course those questions are almostly from me, 
but visitors always have questions as the same as mine. Consequently, those questions are imaginatively asked by you and answered by me.
Maybe you will find the below words are also subtly correct:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You imagine that you asked a question, and finally found the (my) answer here.</li>
<li>You not only imagine that you asked the question, but also imagine that you answered this question. (this imagination deny me, I don't like it).</li>
<li>I asked those questions and you're my imaginary answerer.</li>
<li>I imagine that you imagine&#x2026;&#x2026;recursively.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oops! So many questions and answers, so many you[s] and me[s].
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline5">Can I ask you questions?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
Yes, you definitely can. In fact, everyone can ask others questions . But meantime, others can ignore just like you can ask it.
sometimes I am one of the 'others'.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline6">Why do you blog?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline6">
<p>
"If you can't be googled,". Prof.<a href="http://matt.might.net/">Matt Might</a> just kidded, "you don't exist!".
</p>

<p>
From my perspective, writing blog can achieve 5-R (maybe x-R someday, x &gt; 5, the oringin is 3):
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>[R]elax myself when suffering from troubles of study and/or research,</li>
<li>w[R]iting is my amateur hobby,</li>
<li>[R]efresh my knowledge: writing is a way to extend what you knew and find what you ignored.</li>
<li>a[R]ticles as a self-introduction when making new friends, and most importantly,</li>
<li>[R]ecord my life so that I can maintain an invaluable memory.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline7">Why writing in English?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline7">
<p>
Instead of answering this question logically, I'd like to start to answer psychologically.
</p>

<p>
Still there are some Chinese people regard English as a necessary evil. They hardly try to use English artistically, 
especially after finishing their so-called 
CET-4, CET-6, TOEFL. And, meantime, if they see someone learning from English books, they scream out surprisingly, 
or pretend to be surprise: "Wow! So great are you! your English must be good!". 
</p>

<p>
Also there are people 'proud' of English, they said:
"We teach our total students with total English, and our total textbooks, which are also totally written in total English, have already been adopted by many English universities." That means, 
it is a advertisement of this university. However, it drops a hint that <i>English is the best.</i>, which have already departed from its original intent: 
"We try our best to provide courses to students".
What's worse is that such an advertisement also indicates a fact: "There are no good textbooks in Chinese.".
</p>

<p>
Those two kinds of people are combined by the same <i>interface</i> : English. The one advertised: "We have English, come here!". The other answered:"Great!".
</p>

<p>
In fact, I think, there are a more reasonable attitude the advertiser can learn. They can advertise, "We have to use
English textbooks for teaching, because there aren't great textbooks written in Chinese, and the world also communicates in English.
Using another language, instead of our native language, to teach/learn sounds shameful. But don't panic, you students will be strong enough
and can finally design your textbooks in Chinese. It may be painful at the beginning, please embrace the uncomfortable."
</p>

<p>
I duck when I see who I talked above. The reason I write in English is <b>not</b> because:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>I'm good at English</dt><dd>No, I used to spend little time with it. There always are some syntax errors and typos in my articles.</dd>
<dt>English is a perfect language</dt><dd>No, and never has a language became perfect. English has its own drawbacks(e.g., the lack of rhythm).</dd>
<dt>English is my favorite</dt><dd>No. Personally, I perfer Italian for the sake of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo_Calvino"><i>Itano Calvino</i></a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<b>But</b> because: 
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>I want</dt><dd>I currently appreciate the views that English brought me. I find I can understand things more directly when using English-thinking,
e.g., the difference between teacher and advisor(advice), the relationship between process and processor. Maybe such these understandings are not useful, but interesting.</dd>
<dt>I need</dt><dd>As I mentioned above, the world communicates in English, lots of great textbooks are written in English. English is a must-have If I want to learn much. And I indeed want.
writing in English is a good practice.</dd>
<dt>I can</dt><dd>lots of people don't have courage to, and even can't, write in English. Ah! I've, finally, became the one proud of English,:P</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Nevertheless, I will write in Chinese if I can't express myself or something else in English.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline8">How often do you blog?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline8">
<p>
Asserting that blog is just a plus, not a must-have, I will pay main  attention on other things (e.g., study, play&#x2026;),
one article per month is an ideal.  
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgheadline9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline9">How do you blog?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline9">
<p>
As you can see, I maintain 3 items known as <b>STL</b>:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>[S]chedulings</dt><dd>This item lists my plannings or objectives in short term, planning history can also be found here.</dd>
<dt>[T]echnical articles</dt><dd>This item sounds plausible, that is, my articles may not be technical enough. I'm not attempt to misguide the visitors, 
please read my articles critically and rationally.</dd>
<dt>[L]ife stories</dt><dd>unlike the rational and technical articles, this item aims to be perceptual. It doesn't try to draw a line between
the good and the bad, between the virtuality and the reality.The name <i>life stories</i> can be cheating, it is not about <i>what happened</i>,it is about <i>how I xyz</i>, e.g., how I lie, how I live, and how I love.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
And, as you can't see, I write using  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a> and its <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>, and publish them through a simple shell script to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Thanks them for that 
they provide such great softwares/services without charging anything. I highly recommend them to you.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline10" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline10">Why there are some unfinished articles you published?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline10">
<p>
I enjoy the procedure of writing, but not the result. I am not the one that must finish writing an article and then stop.
If I get stuck, or it's time to do other things, I stop. 
I publish articles by just running a script without efforts. It's pleasant to wait something to happen and it's not painful.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline16" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline16">What's the relationship between you and &#x2026;</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline16">
</div><ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="orgheadline11"></a>C++?<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline11">
<p>
C++ is really my tricky pal. I met him in 2015 and began to play with him. I learn much from his friends (authors of c++ books) and himself(from basic variables to tricky metaprogramming).
I really had fun that time. He will refresh himself in 2017, and I can still grow up with him.
</p>
</div></li>
<li><a id="orgheadline12"></a>Zhejiang University?<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline12">
<p>
She heals me and therefore hurt me, loves me and hence punished me.
</p>
</div></li>
<li><a id="orgheadline13"></a>Linux?<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline13">
<p>
I used to be attracted by the Linux world and dive into it. I had to read many online English documents to repair my system, I was really a tinker that time. I appreciated that doing
anything by keyboard commands. I talked with make, gcc, gdb, emacs, vim, latex, shell, lisp and so on. But recently I am tired to do it. Some softwares in Linux are hard to use, and impossible to love.
</p>
</div></li>
<li><a id="orgheadline14"></a>Great dream?<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline14">
<p>
Stranger. I always heard it but I never see it or own it. I don't know what a great dream is, I believe it's a self-hiposis.
</p>
</div></li>
<li><a id="orgheadline15"></a>Someone?<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgheadline15">
<p>
It's hard to tell. the relationships between people depend on the both of each other. e.g.,
 I'd like to regard all of the beauties as my girl friends, but they always don't think so.
</p>
</div></li></ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline18" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline18">How do you pronounce "research"?</h3>

<p>
Have a look at <a href="./pronouncation-of-research.html">pronouncation of research</a>.
</p>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgheadline19" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline19">Is it the final question?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline19">
<p>
No, it isn't.

<h3 id="orgheadline21">Is it the final question?</h3>
