<h2 id="sec-1">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Have you ever remembered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince">the little prince</a>? He ask 'me' a sheep, and finally, 'I' got impatient, drawing him a box.
</p>

<p>
Today all that I want to say is: University is also, and is only a box.
</p>

<p>
To realize the university(U for short) is really a box, there are three stages we need to walk through. Let's go!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">The first stage: full box</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Just like many other students graduating from high school, I believed a myth that U are a beautiful box full of all the
things I had longed for: friendship, freedom, respect and love. U would give me what I want and I could take anything
out.
</p>

<p>
I felt lost in the first two years and missed many opportunities, I did much terrible jobs and didn't give something honest efforts. One day,
I run on the playground, cried, and murmured:"What's &#x2026; going &#x2026; on?". I used to be active and enthusiastic. What happened to me?
</p>

<p>
I heard some voices, from the heaven or from the hell:
</p>
<div class="center">
<p>
&#x2026;U are a difficult case&#x2026;
</p>
</div>
<p>
I screamed out to the University:"What's U give me? and HOW!". I opened the box and found &#x2026; "Are U university kidding?"
</p>

<p>
I heard some voices, from the heaven or from the hell:
</p>
<div class="center">
<p>
&#x2026;Why?&#x2026;
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">The second stage: circuit box</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
SRTP project opened me a door and leaded me to the research. I pretend to be a grown-up and talk about system with them.
</p>

<p>
Yes, grown-ups always like to talk about systems:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>U are a system, or just like a circuit, aiming to achieve "The same INPUT, the better OUTPUT!"(comparing to the other "circuit").
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I heard some voices, from the heaven or from the hell:
</p>
<div class="center">
<p>
&#x2026;The individual is only a cell&#x2026;
</p>
</div>
<p>
"No, they are denying the individual." I said, "No, I refuse to enter into this circuit."
</p>

<p>
I entered.
</p>

<p>
I met the simplest flip-flop, I saw the register defending its own status, I was blocked by the multiplexer, I got trapped.
</p>

<p>
There seemed no road to "the better OUTPUT". Were there any way turning back?
</p>

<p>
I heard some voices, from the heaven or from the hell:
</p>
<div class="center">
<p>
&#x2026;no RE, and no SEARCH&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;U&#x2026;don't&#x2026;exist&#x2026;
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">The third stage: empty box</h2>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
In the first stage, I was out of the box because I believed that the box was full of what I wanted;
In the second stage, I dived into the box to find my road;
In the third stage, .
</p>

<p>
Full of anything? No, there isn't.
</p>

<p>
The road to the better output? No, there isn't.
</p>

<p>
The grown-ups emphasize the value of U, ignoring the value of me(students).
</p>

<p>
How could circuits work without the knowledge of the INPUT?
</p>

<p>
U is merely an empty box. We must put something in before we can take anything out. There is no friendship in U;
friendship is in students, and students put it into U. We must learn the art and form the habit of giving, loving,
serving, praising to keep the box full.
</p>

<p>
Or, U are another empty box. There is no circuits and no systems. We must emphasize the ability and the existence of
ourself and jump out of the box.
</p>

<p>
I heard some voices, from the heaven or from the hell:
</p>
<div class="center">
<p>
&#x2026;I saw U and U saw me&#x2026;
