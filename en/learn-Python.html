Computing has become a ubiquitous concept since the advent of
electronic computers. After several decades of development in all
fields that involve computing, people studying programming nowadays are
embracing a set of tools of remarkable power. At the same
time, it raises a question: what is the best way to go about learning
to program?
</p>

<p>
The way to learn depends on the goal of the learner, perhaps as well as how
his or her goal is perceived by the instructor. One goal is to study with
a purpose; I want to implement a data analysis algorithm, I want to
process this excel file, I want to send emails automatically. In this
case, one already has a problem to solve, knows that programming
helps, and desires to learn it. Another goal
is to let programming be one's starting point in order to explore the computing
world. This demands a solid ground so as to soar higher.  Two
different goals give rise to two different strageties. To meet the
first goal one seeks what oneself needs in the computing world to
solve the problem, perhaps no more than that. The second type are more
demanding and desires to learn more.
</p>

<p>
This introductory article with linked materials is to meet the need of
the both types of readers. For the former type, I will suggest exactly
the pages of the provided materials to read, while the latter
one is encouraged to study based on the materials until his curiosity
is fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
I have to apologize in advance for two things: a beautiful subject
poorly introduced here and my time too limited to perfect everything
presented.

<p>
Let us start with an example. Liangzu and Zuliang are playing the
game <code>Rock-paper-scissors</code>, and Liangzu wants to always win. How
should he cheat?
</p>

<p>
We need to understand the game first. The way for Laingzu to win is
quite simple.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If Zuliang forms with his hand the shape <code>rock</code>, then Liangzu should
give a <code>paper</code>.</li>
<li>If Zuliang forms with his hand the shape <code>paper</code>, then Liangzu should
give a <code>scissors</code>.</li>
<li>If Zuliang forms with his hand the shape <code>scissors</code>, then Liangzu
should give a <code>rock</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This winning rule may be stated in a more concise way.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> Zuliang forms a rock:
    Liangzu gives a paper
<span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> Zuliang forms a paper:
    Liangzu gives a scissors
<span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> Zuliang forms a scissors:
    Liangzu gives a rock
</pre>
</div>
<p>
If then letting rock and paper and scissors form a set, say \(\{rock,
paper, scissors \}\), then we know from the course that this set is
isomorphic to \(\{1,2,3\}\). Simplifying what we have gives
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> Zuliang gives 1:
    Liangzu gives 2
<span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> Zuliang gives 2:
    Liangzu gives 3
<span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> Zuliang gives 3:
    Liangzu gives 1
</pre>
</div>
<p>
If anybody thinks that the names in the above blok are too long to be
handsome, I will shoot him. But he is correct. Let us denote by \(n\)
and \(m\) the choices of Zuliang and Liangzu respectively. The lovely
and warm block above
becomes cold, or if you want, Python code.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #66D9EF;">def</span> <span style="color: #84B5FF;">rock_paper_scissors</span>(n):
  <span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> n == 1:
    <span style="color: #FF84C9;">m</span> = 2
  <span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> n == 2:
    <span style="color: #FF84C9;">m</span> = 3
  <span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> n == 3:
    <span style="color: #FF84C9;">m</span> = 1
  <span style="color: #66D9EF;">return</span> m
</pre>
</div>
<p>
A few more things to explain. We start with
Lines \(2\) - \(7\). Here
<code>n==1</code> reads "\(n\) equals to \(1\)" and similarly for <code>n==2</code> and
<code>n==3</code>, while by <code>m=2</code> we mean that "let \(m\) have the value of \(2\)" or
that "assign the value of \(2\) to \(m\)". In the first line, we defined a
function named <code>rock_paper_scissors</code>. It takes an input \(n\), and asks
whether \(n\) equals to \(1\), if yes then let \(m=2\). It continues to ask
whether \(n\) equals to \(2\), if yes let \(m=3\). And so on. Finally in the
line \(8\), this function <code>returns</code> the value of \(m\). In mathematical
terms, <code>rock_paper_scissors</code> is merely an injective function from \(\{1,2,3\}\) to
\(\{1,2,3\}\). Alternatively we may call this function \(f\) and we have
\(f(1)=2,f(2)=3,f(3)=1\). Hence, what we do here is precisely transforming
a mathematical function into a piece of Python function. And the
Python function <code>rock_paper_scissors</code> that we wrote has another name,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a>, an algorithm that helps Liangzu cheat,
an algorithm in \(8\) lines of code. More seriously but still informally, algorithms
take some <b>input</b> data, here \(n\), performs a finite sequence of <b>commands</b>, here Lines \(2\) - \(7\), and
produces some <b>output</b>, \(m\), and at last terminates. By commands, we
mean that the instructions which can be implemented in some
programming languages such as Python, not
the one that takes the stars to a girl, or to several girls.
</p>

<p>
To summarize this example, we have done the following things.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We have a problem to solve, here helping Liangzu cheat.</li>
<li>We know exactly how to solve this problem, here the way to win the
game, and we can describe it in natural language.</li>
<li>We realize that this corresponds to a computational procedure,
leading us to implementing a Python function <code>rock_paper_scissors</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="org505cb1f"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Discussions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
More generally, to know how
to transform so as to solve our computational problem, we need to
answer the following questions.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What problem do we want to solve? this is relatively easy to answer. I
want to sort a list of numbers. I want to perform a matrix-vector
multiplication.</li>
<li>What is the algorithm that solves our problem? In most cases there
are existing algorithms for our tasks, and we have to study them.</li>

<li>What does the computer provide to us for implementing our
algorithm? Everybody knows that two plus two makes four. Now, I am
giving you two numbers, \(a\) and \(b\), how could one use the computer to
add \(a\) and \(b\)? This requires to know how to talk to the computer,
even before which it requires to know its language. Here we will
use <b>Python</b> as the language to communicate. And the below is the Python
code to <code>add</code> two numbers. Note that Python have provided us the
symbol \(+\) for addition. Then, the code <code>add(2,2)</code> will give \(4\),
and please guess what is the returned result of
<code>add(414351,51454395)</code>. We also see that Python provides us a way to
define functions such as <code>rock_paper_scissors</code> and <code>add</code>, and the
way to use them, such as <code>rock_paper_scissors(1)</code> and <code>add(2,2)</code>.
It indeed offers more as we will see.</li>
</ol>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #66D9EF;">def</span> <span style="color: #84B5FF;">add</span>(a,b):
  <span style="color: #FF84C9;">c</span> = a+b
  <span style="color: #66D9EF;">return</span> c

<span style="color: #FF84C9;">c</span> = add(2,2)
<span style="color: #66D9EF;">print</span>(c)
<span style="color: #FF84C9;">d</span> = add(414351,51454395)
<span style="color: #66D9EF;">print</span>(d)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Since we have defined the function <code>add</code>, we may immediately use (run) it.
The code <code>c = add(2,2)</code> reads: add two numbers, \(a=2\) and \(b=2\), and
assign the result to \(c\), or store the result in \(c\). If you run this
code segment in Python, you will be able
to see that the value of \(c\), which is \(4\), is printed on the screen
since we wrote <code>print(c)</code>. And similar meaning for the last two lines.
The next block presents the printed result.

<p>
Go back to those three questions that we discussed above.
Any programming activity involves answering them,
implicitly or explicitly. This article is concerned with but the third
one, talking to the computer (via Python). To be a better talker it further requires to
change one's mindset into what we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking">computational thinking</a>. Here is
a comparison between mathematical and computational thinking.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In mathematics, one cares about the existence and uniqueness of
certain objects, as well as the property of it.</li>
<li>If giving some problem to a computer scientist, his naturally asks how
to do computation towards its solution.</li>
<li>They are not entirely isolated. It often
happens that some constructive proof establishing the existence
of some object corresponds to a computational procedure. QR
decomposition is such an example.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The best way to cultivate computational thinking is via programming
practice, for which we will arrange exercises whenever possible. The
idea is that you do not need to know too much Python to solve
problems. On the contrary, very few of it is quite enough. (Pioneers
of computer science used to write programs for the machines which do
not even exist).

We assume that the reader has finished reading the materials
recommended in the previous section, and has installed Python on the
machine. The reader should also know what is Python interpreter
(roughly) and how to run Python code in it.
</p>

<p>
The well-known slogan in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministries_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Ministry_of_Truth">Ministry of Truth</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak">Newspeak</a>: Minitrue) is the following.
</p>
<pre class="example">
「War Is Peace; Freedom Is Slavery; Ignorance Is Strength.」

「戰爭即和平；自由即奴役；無知即力量。」
</pre>
<p>
That is, Minitrue has defined the word <code>War</code> as <code>Peace</code>, and <code>Freedom</code>
as <code>Slavery</code>, and <code>Ignorance</code> as Strength. That is, Ministrue assigns
new semantics to <code>War</code> and <code>Freedom</code> and <code>Slavery</code>.
</p>

<p>
This section is concerned with some basic syntax and semantics about
Python, that is, the language that Python (Minitrue) admits and its
meaning. After learning them we are able to write a variety of Python
programs for different purposes.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
To achieve more than simple calculation, we need more devices. The
first concept towards sophisticated programs is <b>Variables</b>. Variables
allow us to <b>store</b> the intermediate computational results which can
be used in what to come.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span style="color: #FF84C9;">v</span> = 3*3

&gt;&gt;&gt; v

</pre>
</div>
<p>
Based on what has been told so far, we know what the above
fragment means. Here are more details. We <i>defined</i> a variable with
the name <code>v</code>, and assign the value of \(3\times 3\) to it. Then we make
some calculations and the results are as expected. Along the way we
also define another variable with the name <code>b</code> and the value \(20\).
After some computation we assign a new value, here \(4\), to <code>v</code>, after
which, of course, the variable <code>v</code> has a new value and any computation
about <code>v</code> is associated to its new value. Then we write <code>v=v+2</code>. This
line of code involves two steps. First, compute the value of the
expression <code>v+2</code>, which is \(v+2=4+2=6\). Then assign the value of \(6\)
to the variable <code>v</code>. As a result, <code>v</code> as a new value after this sentence.
</p>

<p>
One important rule about wielding variables is that, they can only be
used when they have been defined. Example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">&gt;&gt;&gt; c
<span style="color: #84B5FF;">Traceback</span> (most recent call last):
  File <span style="color: #C1CAFF;">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line 1,<span style="color: #66D9EF;"> in</span> &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name <span style="color: #C1CAFF;">'c'</span> is not defined
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The last three lines are the error message given by Python.
Looking at the last line where we can understand, Python complains that
the name <code>c</code> is not defined.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it is important to have a good name for variables so that those who
read the code immediately understand the role the variable plays in
the program. We will illustrate this point when we are ready to
compose larger programs. At current point it suffices to know that
ordinary names will work as expected. Example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span style="color: #FF84C9;">War</span> = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span style="color: #FF84C9;">Slavery</span> = 4.99
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span style="color: #FF84C9;">Ignorane</span> = 88.8
&gt;&gt;&gt; War
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; Slavery
4.99
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ignorane
88.8

<p>
So far in this section we have written some Python code only in one
line. And from Section 6.1.2 of PP/3rd we know that there are three
constructs that compose the program. Here we will learn how to express
those constructs in Python. These three constructs will be the main
tools that assist us to think computationally.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Sequential</dt><dd>We have met them before. Suppose we have defined two variables
<code>a0=0</code> and <code>a1=1</code>.  We want to
compute the fifth number <code>a4</code> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci sequence</a>,
starting with <code>a0</code>. The code is as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="org-src-container">

</pre>

One verifies that the above code does exactly what we want.
Run this code <a href="https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_interpreter">here</a>, and we will see that Python prints the value of
<code>a4</code>, which is \(3\). The above code block gets excuted line by line, in
agreement with our intuition. We note that each line is a <b>statement</b>.
At a higher level the sequential construct looks like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Each statement corresponds to some computational (sub)-task. To be
more precise, we write
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">&lt;statements&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
That is, we use <code>&lt;statements&gt;</code> to represent a sequence of <code>&lt;statement&gt;</code>.
In the words of PP/3rd, the computer is
to carry out the first subtask completely, then go on and carry out
the second subtask completely &#x2014; never going back to the first
subtask after starting the second subtask.

<dt>Conditional</dt><dd>We have met them before. Recall in the
<code>rock_paper_scissors</code> function that we have used the
conditional construct to deal with different shapes
that Zuliang will form. Conditional construct is a
way to deal with (binary) uncertainty. The baby may
cry or not, it may rain or not, we may go back to
school or not. When facing two choices we need to act
correspondingly for each one. The conditional
construct in Python looks like this:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> a == 1:
  <span style="color: #FF84C9;">b</span> = 1
  <span style="color: #FF84C9;">c</span> = 2
<span style="color: #66D9EF;">else</span>:
  <span style="color: #FF84C9;">b</span> = 0
  <span style="color: #FF84C9;">c</span> = 3
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Assuming <code>a</code> is some variable already defined somewhere, the above
code justifies itself well. If the value of <code>a</code> is \(1\), then let
<code>b=1</code>. Otherwise let <code>b=0</code>. And similarly for <code>c</code>. Special attention must be paid to the
colons at the ends of lines 1 and 3. They are just more than the
<b>syntax</b> of the if-else statment, which Python can recognize. Any
(slight) violation to the syntax can not get excuted by Python. More
generally, the syntax for if-else statement of Python looks like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> &lt;b&gt;:
  &lt;statements&gt;
<span style="color: #66D9EF;">else</span>:
  &lt;statements&gt;

<span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> &lt;b&gt;:
  &lt;statements&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> can be thought of as a value which is either <code>True</code> or
<code>False</code> (<code>&lt;b&gt;</code> for "binary"). For example, if we have written <code>a=1</code>,
the statement <code>a==1</code> will be evaluated by Python
as <code>True</code>, and the value of the statment <code>a==2</code> is False, since
obviously \(1\neq 2\).
</p>

<p>
The second remark about the if-else construct is that, sometimes the
<code>else</code> branch may be omitted (recall <code>rock_paper_scissors</code>).
</p>

<p>
Finally, in Python, and in almost all programming languages, the
if-else construct is a statement. As a result, the above block is
<b>recursively</b> defined, since the if-else statement that it can also
arise in <code>&lt;statments&gt;</code> of the above block. More concretly, the
following is a valid Python program, and is able to deal with more complicated tasks.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> a == 1:
  <span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> b == 3:
    <span style="color: #FF84C9;">c</span> = 2
  <span style="color: #66D9EF;">else</span>:
    <span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> <span style="color: #FF84C9;">g</span> = 203:
      <span style="color: #FF84C9;">c</span> = 100
  <span style="color: #FF84C9;">d</span> = 5
  <span style="color: #FF84C9;">e</span> = 100
<span style="color: #66D9EF;">else</span>:
</pre>
</div>

Describe in your language what the above code is doing.
</p>

<p>
<i>Remark.</i> Do not worry
about whether the assignment statements appearing in the above make
sense, you will eventually replace, for example, <code>c=2</code> by your own
statements which do your job. Just remember our slogan: "Freedom is the
freedom to say that two plus two makes four. If that is granted, all
else follows". The if-else construct gives you some freedom, and
everything else will follow. Here is
an example. You want to write a Python program which replies the
emails automatically. But your replies to your girl friend and father
should be different. This is the code:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> email_sender == <span style="color: #C1CAFF;">"Wife"</span>:
  reply(<span style="color: #C1CAFF;">"Honey Honey!"</span>)
<span style="color: #66D9EF;">if</span> email_sender == <span style="color: #C1CAFF;">"Father"</span>:
  reply(<span style="color: #C1CAFF;">"Roger that!"</span>)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
At some point in your career you will learn in Python how to define the variable
<code>email_sender</code> based on the given information (e.g., you can know the
email address which sends you the email), and  <code>reply</code>.

<dt>Iterative</dt><dd>We have not met them in Python. But we have met
them already in life. Liangzu is a robot worker in the
virtual factory
moving bricks from here to there. He has \(10000\) bricks
to move. There are \(10000\) steps to move it. First, move
the \(0\) -th brick. Second, move the \(1\) -st brick.
Proceeding, and finally, move the \(9999\) -th brick.
Correspondingly the code may be</dd>
</dl>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">move(brick[0])
move(brick[1])
...
move(brick[9999])
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Would everyone like to write \(10000\) lines of code to simply move the
bricks. We desire a simplification. Let \(I\) be the list of integer indices
ranging from \(0\) to \(9999\), that is, \(I=[0,1,\dots, 9999]\).
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #66D9EF;">for</span> each i <span style="color: #66D9EF;">in</span> I
  move(brick[i])
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Reading the above two blocks, they feel equivalent. Clearly, the
latter is much simpler; to iteratively compute a similar thing we do
not need to repeatedly write the code. That's the idea of the iterative
construct. There is only one mere difference between above block and
the <b>for-loop</b> statement in Python.
